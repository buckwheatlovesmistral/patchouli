# Patchouli - Elevate Your DWM Game

**Patchouli** is not just your ordinary status bar for Suckless dwm; it's your ticket to status bar nirvana. Written in a delightful blend of Go and C (mostly C, because we're hardcore like that), Patchouli doesn't just play by the rules of the UNIX philosophy – it makes them way cooler. We've got both your favorite OS families covered, with a primary focus on the BSD squad and a secondary nod to Linux. You see, we at Chansoft believe in equal opportunity awesomeness.

## What Makes Patchouli So Darn Special?

**1. Minimalism on Steroids:** Patchouli doesn't do bloat. It's like a Marie Kondo-approved status bar – only the essential sparks joy. We keep things lean by minimizing the reliance on external libraries. You won't find an alphabet soup of dependencies here, just what the system provides and Go's standard library – ensuring a streamlined, lightweight status bar that won't weigh down your setup.

**2. Todd Howard Approved:** Because of all the effort we've put into Patchouli, you can rest easy knowing that Patchouli just works, and it works efficiently!

**3. Go Go Go (and C):** Our blend of Go and C makes Patchouli not just fast but "I just time-traveled" fast. While many status bars for Window Managers rely on scripting languages for automation, we take a different approach. We harness the power of C for system-level operations, ensuring low-level efficiency. At the same time, Go steps in to perform scripting tasks at breakneck speed, thanks to its compiled nature. The result? A status bar that doesn't just keep up with your demands but zooms ahead, leaving others in the digital dust.

**4. No Docker, Just Metal:** We put our code to the real test — no Docker containers, just pure, unadulterated metal. Because that's how Patchouli rolls.

**5. Tidy, Tidy Code:** You know that feeling when you look at code and it's like staring into the Matrix? With Patchouli, we believe in keeping things crystal clear. We've chosen to use XCB instead of the older, more complex Xlib, resulting in code that's as readable as your favorite bedtime story.

**6. Powered by the Speedster Clang:** We don't mess around when it comes to our code. While some might still be stuck in the GNUslop era (yes, we're looking at you, GCC), we've opted for the sleek and lightning-fast Clang. Why? Because we believe in harnessing the power of LLVM to supercharge our C code. It's like trading in your trusty bicycle for a rocket ship — Patchouli's C code blasts off with Clang, leaving GNUslop in the dust, where it belongs!
